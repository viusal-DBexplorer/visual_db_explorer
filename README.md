Visual AI Natural Language SQL
A preview of the user interface.

Description
A visual, natural-language DataBase explorer and modifier. The solution aims to use a unique low-usage LLM to synchronize natural language queries, UI-based changes, and custom SQL for key DataBase providers.

This project is for anyone who has felt the frustration of "dialect hell" between different SQL databases and wants to work at the speed of thought, not at the speed of looking up syntax.

‚ú® Core Features
Natural Language to SQL: Describe what you need in plain English. The application translates your intent into precise, executable SQL for your target database.

Visual Querying: Modify your database schema by interacting with a visual diagram. The application will generate the correct ALTER TABLE statements for you.

Multi-Dialect Fluency: The intelligent engine understands the subtle syntax differences between PostgreSQL, SQLite, DuckDB, and more.

Live Visual Feedback: Instantly see your database schema as a clean, easy-to-understand Mermaid diagram that updates as you make changes.

üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap
This project is being built around a sophisticated "Two-Tier Engine" for maximum accuracy and efficiency.

Phase 1: The Core Engine & UI Foundation (Current Focus)

[x] Design the core user interface and visual identity.

[ ] Implement the single-file prototype with a functional backend.

[ ] Add dynamic Mermaid diagram generation based on user schema.

[ ] Release the first usable version.

Phase 2: Activating the Two-Tier Engine

[ ] Set up the central Tier 1 model (e.g., a fine-tuned Phi-3) for fast, common queries.

[ ] Implement the "router" logic to escalate complex queries to the user's powerful Tier 2 LLM.

[ ] Implement the transparent data collection policy (with user opt-out) to continuously improve the Tier 1 model.

üöÄ Getting Started
(Instructions will be added here once the first functional prototype is released.)
